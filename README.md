# Decryption
This is a python script that decrypts mono-substitution cipher.

This was our first coding project and hence, it was written poorly but does the job. 

The idea behind it is pretty interesting though; using frequency analysis to dicpher mono-substitution cipher. 

# Prerequisite
-Python 3.6

Have fun!
